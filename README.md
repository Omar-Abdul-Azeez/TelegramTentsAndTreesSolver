# TelegramTentsAndTreesSolver
 This is just a code i made to solve Telegram's [https://telegram.me/gamee]@gamee Tents and Trees game
 because i was too lazy to actually think of a solution... only to think
 how to solve it in code. how dumb xD

# Usage:
 Just run the solver.py file (obviously) and input the required data.
 That is:

 1-The numbers on left of the grid that tell you how many tents should be in a row
 from top to bottom separated by a single space.

 2-The numbers on top of the grid that tell you how many tents should be in a column
 from right to left seperated by a single space.

 3-The coordinates of every tree in the form "x y". that is the x coordinate followed by
 a space and then the y coordinate then press enter to input another tree's coordinates.
 when done, press enter without putting any coordinates.

# Notes:
This is not complete... i'm planning to add trial and error if all else fails
and only then it will be complete. However, it won't be optimized in the slightest.

You are welcomed to edit/optimize any part of the code if you want. And also if you notice
any issues or bugs, Feel free to open an issue. Apart from that anything else will be ignored.
